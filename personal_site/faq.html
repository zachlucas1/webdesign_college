            <h3>How long should it take to build my PC?</h3>
            <p>Typically it should take a week to build your computer and around 3-5 business
              days to ship it to you depending on your location.</p>

            <h3>Is there a warranty?</h3>
            <p>We provide a lifetime warranty on your PC. This covers parts and components that 
              malfunction or stop working for any reason. This does not cover damage that may be caused from dropping or misuse. </p>

          <div class="question-3"> 
            <h3>What do all these parts mean?</h3>
            <p>A processor is like the brain of the computer, it thinks and processes information. RAM is memory that is used to run applications.
            This could be compared to short term memory. Next is storage, this is where you will put all your files. This could 
            be like long term memory. Lastly a graphics card is a seperate component that processes video data and this could be compared
            to your eyes.</p>

            <h3>Why get a gaming PC when there are already consoles?</h3>
            <p>Consoles are awesome, but they aren't for everyone. Some want more power, speed, and quality in their games.
            While consoles do offer this, they are bottlenecked and have a limit. With computers the limit is based on 
            the components you have in your computer. If you want your games to run better, you can simply upgrade 
            your computer! There are also some exclusive games that are only found on PC. Lastly playing on keyboard and
            mouse is better for game control. </p>
