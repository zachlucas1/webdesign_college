      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>&emsp;I am a Computer Information Technology major and I like to work with computers. I have since become interested in building 
        a computer for gaming, and productivity. At the moment prices are high and supply is low for computer parts due to the 
        pandemic, but also competition. Sometimes customers in the market will ask themselves "Can I build an expensive computer 
        without breaking something?" I have noticed that it is easier for companies to get these parts rather than the consumer. 
        My company has a goal of acquiring computer components to build PCs for people's needs and wants. We will provide the customer 
        multiple different options depending on computer parts with an added build fee for labor and time. Ultimately this will make it 
        easier for the customer while building a more than capable computer for what they want!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>&emsp;We hope here at MasterTech that we can appeal to a vast audience. Whether it be your first computer or your fifth, we can help 
        you with what you need. We project that our audience will be vast, it will mainly compose of those young and young adult ages.
        Though we can help anyone with any of their needs that fit into their budget. Whether it be someone that needs a work PC or a 
        gaming and streaming PC, we are here to help. This audience will have a sense of satisfaction and security as we build their 
        computer with leading class experts and technicians. </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      <a href="https://coolors.co/041b29-1c40ca-00a0ea-f4efe9" target="_blank">Palette URL</a>


      <table class="colors">

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Teko  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        &emsp;I chose this font because it makes a good header font that is big, bold, and easy to read. <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Nunito Sans  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        &emsp;I chose this font because it is a sans serif that makes a great paragraph font. It is easy
        to read and look at.<!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>&emsp;This will be the face of MasterTech and the first thing people will see when they are curious 
        about building a computer. It will be well set up, have a good color scheme, and be easily usable 
        for anyone that visits. People will come to visit this site because they need to build a 
        computer. Whether it be for a personal home PC or a large gaming and streaming rig. The market at the 
        moment is tough to find computer parts due to a lack of supply, and an excess of demand. It can be 
        daunting for a consumer to find these components or systems. Luckily, companies have better access 
        and can provide for their consumers. <br>

        <br>&emsp;We will provide competitive prices and a build fee plus tax. We feel that a computer nowadays is a 
        need for everyone regardless of what you are doing. Especially with the recent pandemic, it is almost 
        impossible to survive without one for work, school, or various hobbies. We believe here at MasterTech 
        that we will be one of the best in the market for PC building. We will provide a streamlined experience 
        with competitive prices that you cannot beat anywhere else. </p>

      <h3>Build Your PC</h3>
      <p>&emsp;This is the most important portion of the site. It is where every customer will go to build their 
        computer. On this portion of the site, we will provide many options based on the consumer's needs. 
        It will be easily navigated and will provide sufficient descriptions and prices. We will also provide 
        pictures so that the consumer knows exactly what they are getting. <br>
        
        <br>&emsp;We first will offer a basic home desktop option for someone who needs a computer for everyday computer use. 
        This person will just use the computer for basic web browsing, school, and work. The next desktop we 
        will offer is the beginner series. This desktop will be good for those who want to get into PC gaming, 
        but do not know where to start. This customer will plan on playing lighter games, photo, and video editing. 
        Next up is the intermediate series. This is for those who want a little more power and are willing to pay a 
        bit more. This computer will be capable of playing e-sports titles at high framerates and some higher AAA games 
        at mid to low settings. The next line we will offer is the advances series. This will be the best of the best you 
        can find. Though it will not be cheap, it will be powerful and more than capable of whatever you throw at it. It can 
        play any game at high settings and work through video and photo rendering with ease. Lastly, we will offer an option 
        for a customer to customize and build their computer based on the components we already have. This customer already 
        knows what they want or have specific needs, and we can satisfy them.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>&emsp;Now buying a computer can be a bit of a process sometimes. It sometimes is a huge investment, and people will have 
        questions about their product or the process of building their PC. Some examples of questions they will ask will be 
        “How long does it take to build and ship my PC?” or “What kind of computer should I get?” Buying a computer will 
        sometimes feel like buying a car. You have to shop around for what you like and need, and it takes more time than 
        usual. We hope we can expedite that process and make it happen with ease. We will also have a place to ask questions 
        that we can answer promptly.
