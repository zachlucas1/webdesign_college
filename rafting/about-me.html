      <h2>Zach Lucas</h2> 
      <p>This is my first website so we'll see how this goes! I am currently a CIT major at Brigham Young University - Idaho.
      I am planning on going into the cybersecurity field. I can also go into IT, Networking, or Cloud Architecture with this major as well. 
      I have always been interested in computers and technology and I have recently started taking classes for this major. So far it is going good!</p>
      
      <p>I have a few hobbies that I like to do. I really like to do film and digital photography. I did it all throughout High School and some in
        college. My favorite kind of photography is something called star trails. To recreate it you go out at night with bright stars, no clouds, 
        and you open up the exposure for long periods of time. I will attatch below a few of my recent photos. I also enjoy gaming, the outdoors,
        video and photo editing, and being with family and friends.</p>

        <p>I currently work for the IT Department at BYUi in the Print support division. It is a lot of fixing of printers, and delivering paper and ink.
        I enjoy it as it is a good job for my major, gives me technical experience, and is flexible with my school schedule. I have learned a lot from
        it and I hope to become more skilled at my job to gain even more experience.</p>
        
        <p>I am taking this course because it is required for my major, but it is also something that I have considered in the past. I am excited to learn
        more about web development!</p>
